### Description
Sudoku is one of the most popular puzzle games of all time.
The objective of Sudoku is to fill a 9-by-9 grid with digits from 1 to 9 such that each column, row, and box (or called "subgrid", "region", "block") contain every number in the set {1, ... , 9} exactly once.

This web application features **generating** and **solving** standard 9-by-9 Sudoku puzzles of different difficulty levels (i.e., easy, medium, and hard). For the Sudoku generating algorithm, please refer to [1]. The backtracking technique [2] is implemented as the solving algorithm here.
