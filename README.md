# Face Recognition System

## Introduction

This project implements a face recognition system using machine learning techniques. The system can detect and recognize faces in images or live video streams. It uses a combination of facial feature extraction and classification algorithms to achieve accurate recognition.

## Features

- Face detection in images and video streams
- Face recognition with high accuracy
- Support for adding new faces to the database
- Real-time face recognition
- Easy integration with other applications
